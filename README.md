# Snake Game

A modern take on the classic Snake Game built in Python. This repository contains all the source code and assets required to play the game. Enjoy maneuvering your snake as you collect food, avoid obstacles, and try to beat your high score!

## Overview

The Snake Game is a simple, yet addictive arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length with every piece of food consumed. The primary objective is to avoid colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's own growing body. As the game progresses, the snake moves faster, increasing the challenge.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:**  
  Relive the classic experience with smooth, incremental increases in difficulty as your snake grows.

- **Score Tracking:**  
  Your current score is displayed during gameplay, letting you track your performance.

- **Responsive Controls:**  
  Use keyboard inputs to control the snake's movement (typically with the arrow keys).

- **Simple and Clean UI:**  
  The game offers a minimalist design that focuses on essential gameplay elements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**  
  Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **Pygame:**  
  This project uses the Pygame library for graphics and event handling. To install Pygame, run:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
  If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before installing Pygame.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository or Extract the Zip File:**
   - **Git Clone:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Snake_game-main.git
     cd Snake_game-main
     ```
   - **Zip Archive:**  
     If you downloaded the zip file, extract it to your preferred directory.

2. **Make Python Scripts Executable (Optional):**  
   If you are on a Unix-like system and want to run the script directly:
   - Add the following shebang line at the top of your main Python file (if not already present):
     ```python
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     ```
   - Make the script executable by running:
     ```bash
     chmod +x snake_game.py
     ```

## Running the Game

To start the Snake Game, navigate to the project directory and execute the main game script. For example:
```bash
python snake_game.py
```

Once running, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snakeâ€™s direction.

## Gameplay Instructions

- **Objective:**  
  Guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls or yourself.

- **Controls:**
  - **Up Arrow:** Move up
  - **Down Arrow:** Move down
  - **Left Arrow:** Move left
  - **Right Arrow:** Move right

- **Game Over:**  
  The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or itself. Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score!
